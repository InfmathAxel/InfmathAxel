### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Axel Demuth, a second-year Master's student in Mathematics and Computer Science at the CSMI program (Scientific Computing and Mathematical Innovation). My studies primarily focus on Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Computing, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and the numerical resolution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

I am currently seeking an internship for the second semester of 2024 in the field of Data Science or Artificial Intelligence.

I already have experience working in a team environment, having completed an internship where I contributed to a project on generating LOD2 building meshes using the CGAL library from point cloud data. You can find the report for this project in the Internship Report 2024 section at Building-LOD2 here : https://feelpp.github.io/ktirio-geom.docs/internship-reports-2024/building_lod2/index.html
